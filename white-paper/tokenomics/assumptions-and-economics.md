# Assumptions & Economics

### Initial approach

{% hint style="success" %}
During the first year we can use the economic models of S3, and S3-like technologies, Dropbox and others like them. But in 2 year period and becoming market standard of networking CDN we expect token price to appreciate too. What opportunities Cache network will provide is that it can be used almost in any web technology and in itself is potential to provide service for enterprises. Exposing API on the Djib persistence layer and integration with cloud service would also attract more enterprise level customers.

### How the coin appreciates

{% hint style="success" %}
Every coin is guaranteed to provide a lifetime 1GB cloud storage with the supply method over 60 year this give enough time to market adaption and also value appreciation of the token.&#x20;

Every year from the pool almost two million coins get release and will become available in the market. And this release should be entangled to the fact that Djib adds approx.1 peta byte storage.&#x20;

### Price of Djib

{% hint style="success" %}
For the first year and given the volume available in the market, token price starting point we believe token is highly undervalued but by adding more to our offering we believe the token price will be stabilized around 6.5 to 8.5

35 X for early investors after a year

17.5X for IDO investors

Slow emission of the token and being backed by a service and 1 Gb also contributes on token value appreciation
