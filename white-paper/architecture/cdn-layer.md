# CDN Layer

Djib uses a distributed content delivery network (CDN) that combines and utilizes currently existing CDNs and our proprietary Service delivery, this layer of our network is installed on top of entire network to serve clients better (multi-CDN, or CDN of CDNs)

The layer consists of&#x20;

* Public CDN
* Djib cache nodes&#x20;

### Djib Multi-CDN Architecture

Djib CDN is a one of the CDNs in the cache network which this CDN initially will be maintained by Djib, and by 2023 it is planned to be delivered to the community. By providing bandwidth, storage and small computational power each percipient will receive Djib token as incentive, by being an edge server in the network you will get some coins.

### Benefits of Multi-CDN Approach

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a **group of geographically-distributed servers which help you deliver your content faster to users.** However, CDNs can perform differently at different times or in different locations. They can experience outages and slowdowns. With a multi-CDN strategy your content is hosted with more than one CDN provider, enabling you to drive better application performance and in many cases, lower costs.

Individual CDN providers, while they operate large commercial networks, do not have unlimited capacity. Large peaks in traffic may overwhelm your CDN provider. Also, CDNs can experience regional or even global outages. With Multi CDN, in case of a problem you can immediately divert traffic to another CDN which is up and running.

If a CDN is compromised, or taken down by a DDoS attack, it can take out thousands of websites relying on that CDN to deliver content. Having multiple CDN providers reduces this risk, because itâ€™s highly unlikely attackers will take out two or more CDN providers at the same time.
