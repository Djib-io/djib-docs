# Case study: Solana

* Solana is fast and one the best networks with high throughput but there is no Solana native file storage project&#x20;
* Solana NFTs are not immutable and can be modified even when immutable flag set to “TRUE”!&#x20;
* Usage of Filecoin and Arweave is costly: &#x20;
  * Split user experience &#x20;
  * Loss of large amount of the value that could have been captured in the Solana ecosystem, but flows out into other networks&#x20;
