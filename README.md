# Introduction to Djib

## Origin story



We have been helping different size organisations with the adoption of edge technologies, such as cloud service integration, blockchain and AI. When some of our clients decided to issue NFTs and asked us to mint and maintain their NFTs as well as the underlying technology, Solana, which combines solid scientific knowledge with exceptionally high throughput speed in a carbon neutral way, became an obvious choice. Thanks to the great tooling (such as Metaplex, Candymachine, etc.) on Solana, minting NFTs is an easy task. However, we found a potential mis-implementation and a gap in the Solana ecosystem which haven’t been addressed yet.



With some art and metadata you can easily mint an NFT and upload the asset literally anywhere. This means that even when the "immutable" flag on the NFT is set to “TRUE”, the token is mutable and can be updated without leaving any footprint on the blockchain. This is the mis-implementation. And the fact that – if you want to have your file storage on the blockchain, you need to choose external networks such as Arweave or Filecoin – is not only an expensive inconvenience for the user, but also an important leakage of value from a network point of view. These external networks require you to adopt their crypto currency which drains large amount of value that could have been easily injected to the Solana ecosystem.



We have been always following Solana and were searching for opportunity to contribute to the network in other meaningful ways and believe that the current proposal for the creation of Djib – a Solana-native file storage solution which ensures the true immutability of Solana-based NFTs – will have a significant positive impact on the both the completeness and economics of the Solana network.
